question: |
  Choose a SNAP or cash benefits representative
subquestion: |
  This form can help you name an **authorized representative** to act on your behalf and help manage your SNAP account, cash benefits account, or both. Your representative does not need to have legal guardianship or a court appointment, but you do have to give your written consent, which can be done by filling out and submitting this form. 

  Use this form to:
  ### Name a SNAP representative:

  * Allow someone to sign your SNAP forms, report changes, and talk about your case with DTA 

  * Allow someone to shop with your SNAP benefits, which would give your representative an EBT card that lets them shop for you

  ### Name a cash benefits representative:
  
  * Allow someone to talk about your cash benefits case, including reporting changes and talking about your case with DTA

  * Allow someone to get money from your cash benefit account, giving them an EBT card that lets them get money from your TAFDC or EAEDC account

  It is up to you how much authority you give to your representative. *Only one person may be named on each form but this person may have multiple roles.* Choose someone you trust, and remember that the person you choose must give proof of identity. Once you submit this form, you can cancel or change this request at any time, by calling 1‐800‐997‐2555.
